No speaky English?

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I added google translate functionality to search a google translation. 

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
I learned that Google Translate has its own way of parse url links. It replaces certain keywords with other modifiers, which are not typically the usual ones that Google uses. Therefore, I had to expirement and see what Google Translate replaced them to so that my URL matches with the Google Translate URL Parser.

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I don't like the fact that the url's are not consistent, but there's nothing much I can do as it is something that must be fixed on Google's end.
