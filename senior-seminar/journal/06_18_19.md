## Topic:
Remind me what I'm doing again?

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I implemented the reminder service and modified the timer regular expression to be more modular.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
Later.js is a Java Script library that acts as a time manager and can hadle time reminders for me effeciently. Unforunately it can't do small times like a 10 second reminder; however, it does work well with anything over 30 seconds. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I like this new service and I'm happy to have added this to my service. I tried using the Google Calender API; however, that requires user sign in and I do not want to do any authentication on the client side.
