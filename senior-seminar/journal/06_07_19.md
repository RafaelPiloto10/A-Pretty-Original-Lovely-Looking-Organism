## Topic:
Web Sockets vs POST/GET Reqeusts

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
Researched Websockets and why they are a better option than post requests.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
Websockets are a better option for my service because some functionality will need to be asynchronous (Don't block the stack) and we don't want every user making POST/GET requests to request information every second. Instead websockets can alert the user the information is reading to be transmitted and can transmit it for me instead of having to ask the user to make another request. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I think this functionality will make the network aspect of my project less of a headache as well simplify the code needed.
