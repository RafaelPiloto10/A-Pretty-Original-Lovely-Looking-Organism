## Topic:
Natural Language Processing = Processing Natural Language = Language Processing Natural

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I researched and implemented a basic example of natural language processing. I am using Wit.ai, a web service that conducts all of the language processing and training for me and then making API calls to the service to get results.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
What Natural Language Processing is and how it can improve my project: I am currently using regular expressing to detect commands from the user. This however, means that the user must follow a strict sense of wording and limited to verbatim commands. By implemeting natural language processing, the user can freely request a command and then the AI will be able to predict what the user is requesting in terms that my service can understand. That is: what is the command, the query, and the platform.

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I cannot wait to implement it! It makes my program incredibly flexible and a lot more natural.
