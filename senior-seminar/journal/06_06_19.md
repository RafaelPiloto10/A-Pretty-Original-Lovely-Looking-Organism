## Topic:
Weather API Research
## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
Researched a weather api as a potential service to my personal assistant. The api will be able to pull the current weather data as well as the weather data forcast for 5 days in advance for free.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
I cannot make more than 60 calls per minute to this api. The service is free, however, I am limited to just current data and a 5 day forecast. I can implement weather maps if I choose to as it is also a free service. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I think it will be a great addition to my personal assistant. It a diverse and unique option to my assistant.
