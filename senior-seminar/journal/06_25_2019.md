## Topic:
Dreaded CORS Error

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I found a bug in my program: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when using my actual IP address instead of localhost. This helped expose the bug, so that when I deploy the site there are no issues. After patching the issue I also discovered an issue with express sessions and persistancy. For some reason, my cookies were resetting after making a call to the `/auth` route, which inadvertently caused the authentication to fail everytime. The issue was that I was making the call to `localhost` when using my IP as the site url, which caused the server to get confused on who was making what request.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
How to fix the dreaded CORS issue and realize a minor development bug with authentication. Testing when deployed will be necessary.

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
It troubled me intially, because I did not understand what was wrong. Then I realized that I was referring to the same client in two different manners, which may have caused the server to be confused.
