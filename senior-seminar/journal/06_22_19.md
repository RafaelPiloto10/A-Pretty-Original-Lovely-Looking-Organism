## Topic:
What a witty result!

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I further researched Wit.ai, a natural language processing service, that allows me to introduce modularity into my service. I had to provide the model with training data and what it should expect in order for the ai to accurately detect my commands and trigger keywords. With this, I found a bug in my reminder service that prevented me from setting reminders on specific dates. This is because Later.js was using UTC time instead of local time and therefore could not detect specific dates to my time zone. I fixed this by calling `later.date.localTime()`.

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
Later.js uses UTC time instead of local time. This caused a bug in my reminder service. I also learned how to better train a NLP model in order to produce optimal results. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I am excited to continue training my model and further increasing the capabilities of the current service.
