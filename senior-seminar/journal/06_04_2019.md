## Topic:
Speech Recognition Library

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I researched potential speech recognition libraries. I found one called Annyang, however, it appears to be very limiting. 
Google also has their own speech recognition library with a lot more functions and features. Google's libary however, limits users
to using Chrome or other browesers that support the API. s


## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
Speech recognition is difficult to do especially if you don't want to write your own library because of privacy issues.
Speech recognition also uses text analysis and machine learning to better accurately convert audio to text.


## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I think choosing the right libray introduces unique challanges, and I will most likely have to write my own text analysis library
to better accurately understand what the user is attempting to ask for as well as have flexibility in my code.
