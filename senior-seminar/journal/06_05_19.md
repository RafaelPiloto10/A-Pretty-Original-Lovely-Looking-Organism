## Topic:
Nodemailer API (Send Emails)

## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
Researched Nodemailer and how to send emails with the API. I was able to test the library and make sure it functions as intended. 

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
How the library is used properly. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I like that it will be used server side and will be able to send emails. I will have to provide a gmail accound however, which is a downside to having the service publicly available. 

## Important links:
