## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I deployed my A.P.O.L.L.O service with a new service that I found called Heroku. I also created an API service for my Spotify API that my service will be using that also uses Heroku.


## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
I learned that Heroku that has auto-deployments that can be detected after a new push to github. I also learned a couple of new HTTP codes for API usage. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I am super excited to have found Heroku! The service allows me to deploy my apps at no charge and auto-deploys any time I make a change. The old service that I was going to use "now" does have this feature as far I know. Heroku also has a logs feature where I can see the logs my service is outputting, which is really accessible and useful!
