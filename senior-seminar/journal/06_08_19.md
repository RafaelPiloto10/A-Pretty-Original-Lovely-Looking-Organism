## Topic:
Sentiment Analysis for better response
## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
I researched Sentiment Analysis libraries to better analyze a user's command and the feelings associated with it. This will allow me, if properly implemented, to respond to the user in a similar manner. For example, if the user seems angry we can respond in a sarcastic or calm manner. If the user seems happy, we respond in a similar tone, etc. 

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
The sentiment analysis libraries are all server based, which means every command is going to be sent back to the server. Although some commands are inevitably going to have to be sent back to the server, I would prefer to keep as much as possible on the client side to avoid cluttering the server. This will reduce wait time as we don't have to wait for the client to receive a response to then reply to the user. 

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I am a little indecisive as to whether or not I should add it. I did find a libary that can run on the client side, however, it does not seem to be very accurate.
