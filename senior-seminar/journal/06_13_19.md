## Paragraph 1: What did you do?
Implemented the Node-Mailer function so that my service can now send emails to who ever I want. 

## Paragraph 2: What did you learn?
Web recogtiniton tends to be lazy and doesn't like to be turned on immediately after recently being turned on. This results in the recognition "crashing" before the user can input information causing the program to be stuck.

## Paragraph 3: How did you feel about it?
I am very frustrated because I spent the last 4 hours trying to find a way to fix it. I can only implement delays, which make my program seem slow but at the minimum functional.
